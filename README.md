# Building-Hotel-Search-Engine-using-Python
This is my first project that I made for DQLab project challenge to building hotel search engine using recommender system. Recommender systems can be classified into 3 types: 

1. Simple recommenders 
2. Content-based recommenders and 
3. Collaborative filtering engines.

Feel free to give any feedback!
